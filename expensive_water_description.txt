I used the command curl with a URL argument to pipe the output to the filter.py script and run that file from the internet through that script. Then I used the command cat to pipe the argument "expensive_water.csv" into the command csvstat and create a new file called expensive_water_summary.txt as the output. Looking at the file, I can see that I've filtered the file to only include rows where more than $1000 was spent on water in that quarter, as intended by the filter.py script.
